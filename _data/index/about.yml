  text: Generating innovative ideas has always been my forte. Serving the community has also always been my passion. Over the years, I have committed myself to projects that allowed both my strength and passion to flourish. In the process, I have acquired a competency in technical skills, design and marketing. 

- title: Work Experience
  text: Since an early age, I have been experimenting with programming through basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made my first foray into proper software development in high school when I participated in Young Rewired State Singapore, a coding competition in which my team clinched the Best in Show award. My skills were further developed as a Computer Engineering Student. From programming languages to hardware expertise, the course has granted me the privilege of acquiring a diverse set of technical knowledge.

  text: I also possess a deep-rooted passion for graphic design. Through countless projects, I have first-hand understanding of the importance of good design in any context. The Innovation and Design-Centric Program in NUS has expanded on this, equipping me with tools such as the Value Proposition Canvas and Vigorous Prototyping in the Five Stages of Design Thinking, helping me better execute my ideas with models. These skills were put into practice through two projects, GramPS and MedSlack. The former is a GPS wearable to allow elderly who are reluctant to leave their house due to restricted mobility and the latter is a medical wearable system with a user interface to track patientâ€™s vital signs in the Emergency Department.

  text: I am also comfortable with marketing. Having been put in publicity related leadership roles for multiple large-scale events, I picked up valuable marketing knowledge to achieve breakthrough in terms of popularity and reach. I also learnt to work with a tight budget and small manpower size, which is a common scenario in the start-up environment.
 
- title: How I Can Contribute
  text: My strength lies in my ability to see things from a wider perspective. In addition, what sets me apart is that I strike a balance between the logical and practical side of an engineer and the creativity and innovative side of a designer. Equipped with a wide variety of skills set, I will be able to take on projects of various nature. Firstly, from a variety of internships and modules, I have learnt to pick up new frameworks and languages more quickly. Secondly, my experience with design-thinking allows me to frame problems properly instead of being bounded by set requirements. Lastly, the multitude of types of work I have been involved in allows me to inject fresh perspective into any project. Apart from the skills I possess, my gritty personality and eagerness to learn ensures that I will be ready to take on any challenges in this internship journey. 

- title: Internship Objective
  text: In the upcoming year, I am seeking an internship experience which allows me to improve on my programming, designing and product development skills. I am also looking forward to contributing back to the technology industry, which has brought so much convenience to the world. With my relevant exposure to web design and general coding through my courses and past internships, I believe that I can contribute on both technical and business fronts.
