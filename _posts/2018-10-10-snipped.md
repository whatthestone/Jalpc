  This project was done for the NUS Overseas Colleges New Ventures Creation module. The aim of the project was to develop an idea and come up with viable business models for the startup idea. The final pitch deck below was used to pitch for the NUS Overseas Colleges VIP Grant.

<br>
  The same project was also presented at the Oakland Startup Weekend 2018 as a Women in Tech event-finder. However, after performing several rounds of market validation, the idea pivoted to a greater scope and a narrower function - which developed into the latest product, Snipped.

  We built the prototype using React Native. Here is our <a href="https://github.com/weikangong/snipped">Github</a> repo.<br>
