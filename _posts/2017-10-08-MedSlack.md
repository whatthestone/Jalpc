<p> This project aims to build a system which allows the collection and reading of vital signs to be simpler and more convenient for hospital staff. It integrates wireless vital-sign measurement and reading through a User Interface to view data collected via trend charts and more. Data analytics in this aspect allows doctors and nurses to see trends quickly and thus be able to diagnose more accurately. This project was done for the Innovation and Design Centric Program Project, in collaboration with National University Hospital Emergency Department. </p><br>
